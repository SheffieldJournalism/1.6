        <p>Religion has always been a murky concept for me personally. On the one hand it provides a way of life that generally builds charitable and faithful communities through a common belief. On the other, it causes human beings to see division and disparity between sects of people who differ only in the belief they have adopted.

          I have steered away from religion for most of my life; my primary school nativity is probably the closest I have come to Christianity.</p>

          <p>As a young adult, I cannot see past the inequality that religion feeds into mankind. Until I stumbled across the Bahai faith, a teaching which centres around the concept of unity.

          A faith which is not defined by geographical location, colour, or creed. A faith that does not discredit those religions that has stood before it. A faith unlike any other I had seen. So, over the past four months, I have been on a journey to learn all I can about the Baha’i, a faith which has only been around for 200 years and is today’s fastest growing religion.

          <p>I began with the origins of the faith. I needed an educational foundation to understand the roots of the religion and how it has blossomed since. The faith was founded in the city of Shiraz in south Iran in the 19th Century. Initially, the faith was merely a religious movement, in line with the Islamic Shia sect.

          <p> In 1844, a young merchant in the city took the title of ‘The Bab’, announcing that he was he bearer of a message from God and founded the Babi faith, a prerequisite of the Baha’i faith.</p>

          The Baha’is believe that there are cycles of faiths and religions that come one after another, marked by prophets. The Adamic Cycle which began with Adam and lasted approximately 6000 years, came to an end with the introduction of the Babi faith. The new cycle was called the Baha’i Cycle or the Cycle of Fulfilment.
          </p>

          <p>Online research had its limitations however, and I wanted to speak to a Baha’i to gain a greater insight of the origins of the fait. So, I reached out to Shahla Mehrgani, a PhD researcher and lecturer at the University of Sheffield’s International College. Shahla herself is a Baha’i and prior to working in Sheffield, she studied at the Baha’i Institute for Higher Education.

            <p>Baha’is believe that the human race are given God’s teachings through what they call ‘Manifestations of God’, also known as ‘Devine Educators’. The concept itself is simple. In order for mankind to progress, God sends to Earth ‘manifestations’ or prophets, to bestow upon the human race its teachings. The revelation of many of these prophets have resulted in the foundation of other major faiths, but Bahai’s believe in the unity of God and thus the unity of manifestations and in extension, the unity of the religions who follow each prophet.

            ‘The Bab’ and his foundation of the Babi faith was in preparation for the final Manifestation of God: Bahá'u'lláh. Bahá'u'lláh thus founded the Baha’i religion as it is known today.</p>

      <p>Although the wealth of information Shahla bestowed on me sounded lovely, it also sounded idealistic and if I’m honest, impossible. Maybe it was my scepticism in mankind’s ability to work towards a global unification.

        However, I was adamant that my exploration into the faith would not to be blurred by my initial subjectivities and I was eager to meet as many people as I could who were part of the Baha’i community.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, Shahla put me into contact with Darius Lee, a medical student at the University of Sheffield, who is an extremely active member of the Baha’i community in and around the city.

            I was grateful to be invited into Darius’s home and we sat down to chat about all parts of the religion. I was extremely interested in finding out more about some of the core beliefs that sew the Baha’i faith together. When I asked Darius, he described to me the Baha’i beliefs of:</p>

  </div>
</div>

    <div class="content2">
      <p>Worship is at the heart of the Baha’i community, but the faith has no clergy system. Therefore, a large part of worshipping God is individual; Baha’is will pray several times a day, but there is no set routine or process in which one connects with God.

        Baha’is read their scriptures individually or collectively and they try to understand them. Devotional sessions are also held within the community, whereby Baha’is can bring along scripture ready to discuss in the sitting.

        What is important to note however, is that worship and prayer within the Baha’i faith are not mutually exclusive to other beliefs and even those who do not believe in God are welcome to community gatherings.

        What was initially most striking about Darius was his love for his faith, if I am honest his optimism and positivity were contagious, and this made sense when I asked how his religion has shaped him.
      </p>

      <p>“On one level the faith shapes the decisions I make. To have a firm belief in the oneness of mankind and have a firm belief that the unity of mankind is not just possible, it’s inevitable and will happen in who knows how long, but Bahá'u'lláh says this is what will happen.</p>

      <p>“I think that gives you an optimism and I can see that when I am with my friends. They say Darius how can you always be so optimistic about humanity, look at all the problems that we’re facing.</p>

      <p>“And that gives you strength and motivation to work towards that unity. Instead of despairing, instead of looking at all the horrible things that are happening to humanity; instead we think how are we building unity?</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
        <p>“There are forces of disintegration, disunity: war, poverty, terrorism, religious fanaticism; but there are also forces of unity, and as a Baha’i, you strive towards these forces of unity and integration.”</p>

      <div class="comtext1">
        <p>My interview with Darius was engrossing. One thing I did begin to understand was the importance of family and community within the faith.</p>

        <p>A community that is international. Despite not having local places to worship God, the Baha’i faith have built what they call Houses of Worship. There are eight houses in total across the globe, at least one on each continent, and can be seen as a literal symbol of the Baha’i teaching of unity, because they are not exclusive to Baha’is.</p>

        <p>The Houses are places in which any man, woman or child can come for a quite space of worship, regardless of their religious backgrounds.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="comtext2">
      <p>With this thought, and in the interim of setting up my next interviews, I reached out to Yas Taherzadeh, a Baha’i from London who works with Oxfam, in an attempt to speak to someone of the faith outside of Sheffield on their views of family and community. </p>

      <p>“The Bahá’í community sees the family unit as the nucleus of human society—a space within which praiseworthy morals and capacities essential to the betterment of society are to be developed,” she tells me.</p>

      <p>“It recognises that the habits and patterns of conduct nurtured within the family are carried into the workplace, into the local community, into the social and political life of the country, and into the arena of international relations.</p>

      <blockquote class="Yas" cite="http://">
          <p>“For Baha’is, the connection between the individual and the society is intrinsically linked, and the development of each is dependent upon the other.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But without a clergy system I struggled to understand how this strong sense of community was even viable for Baha’is. However, I came to discover two important elements relating to this concern.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>The first is that within the faith there is what is known as the ‘Lesser Covenant’, which is a promise between Bahá'u'lláh and humanity. It was written that when he dies, Baha’is will be guided by his son Abdu’l-Bahá who was the sole interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh’s words. When he passed, Abdu’l-Bahá bestowed title of guardianship on his grandson Shoghi Effendi.

        The second is that the faith has an administrative system in which Baha’i affairs are managed.
      </p>

      <p>This elected system starts in Baha’i localities throughout a country, whereby members of the local community will elect nine Baha’is each year to sit on what is known as the Local Spiritual Assembly. Each year, the delegates of these localities will gather together and will elect members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In the UK this occurs in London.

        Every five years delegates from each NSA will gather in Haifa, Israel, the Baha’i world centre and will elect nine members to make up the Universal House of Justice: the top of the Baha’i administrative order. When Shoghi Effendi passed, he wrote Baha’is would then be guided by UHJ.</p>

          <p class="worshiptext4">To gain an insight into the workings of a Local Spiritual Assembly, I contacted Andisha Croft who sits on the Sheffield-based assembly.

          <p class="worshiptext5">It seems that the heart of this faith does not lie in ancient scripture or holy texts but lives in the community and interactivity between Baha’is across the globe. I asked Andisha how important the social element of the faith was for the local Baha’i community:</p>

      <h1 class="subhead wow tada">Naw Ruz!</h1>

      <p>Up to now however, I felt like I was on the outside looking in. I had heard about the importance of community from many Baha’is, but I had not seen it. Thankfully however, Darius had invited me to Naw Ruz, the Bahai new year celebration in Sheffield. Upon attending Naw Ruz, I learnt first-hand two crucial things about the Baha’i.</p>

      <div class="nr1 wow flipInY">
        <p class="nrtext1">The first is the striking diversity within the community. As we, Darius, myself and a few of his friends entered the community centre in Nether Edge to find tables laid out across the hall, I was taken aback at the range of ethnicities of the congregation of people who had come together to celebrate their new year.

            It was not a naive belief that ethnicity is a limiting factor to the religion one can follow that caused my surprise, it was the depth and breadth of the people themselves. I met immigrants from the middle east, white middle class families, doctors, charity founders, a BBC journalist and so many more, all sewn together by their belief in the Baha’i way of life.
        </p>
        <iframe class="dancing" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZYmZoTp35-c?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      </div>

      <p>Scriptures were read to the hall, as well as performances from Darius himself. The hall was then split into teams and pitted head to head in a general knowledge quiz and what is a new year’s celebration without a bit of musical chairs?</p>

      <p>The second and just as important thing that I learnt at Naw Ruz, was a Baha’is love for food. This particular celebration was potluck, where any member could bring a dish or desert they had made to the celebration.</p>

      <p>A long line formed as the serving area opened, releasing the cacophony of delicate spices and engrossing smells, calling the congregation of people like the Pied Piper. Tables were pushed back into a U shape and the feast commenced.</p>

    <h1 class="subhead wow tada">Life as a Baha'i</h1>

    <p>This was the first time I had seen the lives of Baha’is. Everything is always so foreign until you see people in their natural surroundings. The laughter and unity of individuals and families brought together by their faith.

      So, I wanted to learn more about how the Baha’i faith influences the life of a Baha’i. At the Naw Ruz celebration I met Ieva and Michael who were willing to speak to me about their faith.</p>

      <div class="ieva wow flipInX">
        <p>For Ieva, the Baha’i faith is a way of life, rather than seeing religion and lifestyles as two mutually exclusive entities. Their faith has literally brought them together and touches every part of their daily lives.</p>

        <h2 class="subhead2 wow tada">How Autonomous Is Your Life?</h2>
      <div class="autonomy1">
      <p>What I came to question then, with a faith that is as much a lifestyle as it is a religion, is how Baha’is consider God to have control over their lives.</p>

      <p>Is volunteering to help better the community and in extension the world in which we live, part of God’s blueprint? </p>

      <p>In many cases when it comes to faith, the religion and the way you choose to live your life are separate. From what I have learnt during my exploration of the Baha’i faith, this is not the case.

        For the Baha’i, the life of the individual begins at conception when the soul associates itself with the embryo. When death occurs, the body returns to the world of dust, while the soul continues to progress in the spiritual worlds of God. The part of the Baha’i is to do as much as they can to develop the soul in this lifetime.</p>

      <p>I feel refreshed and enlightened to have been able to speak to a community who strive towards the betterment of the world, rather than the betterment of themselves in the afterlife.</p>
